            <p class="text-grey">Zerodha, may or may not, request for sensitive information from You at the time of account opening, which would include but not be limited to, (i) setting a password; (ii) financial information such as Bank account or credit card or debit card or other payment instrument details; (iii) information such as name, contact number, gender, date of birth, residence and employment addresses, father&rsquo;s/mother&rsquo;s and spouses names, bank account details, scans/copies of document proofs of address &amp; identity such as Photograph, PAN, passport, drivers license, Aadhaar (voluntarily) etc. (iv) uploading signature proof/photo etc. All such information would be for the purpose of: identity verification and background checking for account opening as per KYC &amp; AML Rules, personalising services offered to you, keeping you updated of our products and services relevant to you, information pertaining to our services you&rsquo;ve subscribed to, and for any legal and regulatory / audit purposes.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">Under Regulation 5 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, Zerodha is obliged to provide every registered user of Zerodha with a readable copy of the personal information you have provided us.</p>

            <h3>Aadhaar user consent policy</h3>
            <h4>Voluntary Act</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">The act of providing your Aadhaar is voluntary in nature, which will only be required for completing your account opening procedure online and for digitally signing the Zerodha account opening form. Your Aadhaar may also be used as a proof of address as an alternative choice to drivers license or Passport copy, which is a voluntary decision to be made by You. </p>
            <p class="text-grey">You may alternatively choose to go through the offline route of account opening by physically signing all such account opening documents, which does not require you to share your Aadhaar information at all. </p>
            <h4>Zerodha does not store any Aadhaar information</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">During your online account opening process, you do not input any Aadhaar details on the Zerodha platform. You would be issuing your Digital Aadhaar to Digilocker, from where Zerodha (Zerodha is registered as a Requester on the Digilocker platform) would receive information, based on your consent to allow Digilocker to share such information with Zerodha, limited to: (1) The last four digits of your Aadhaar / VID (Virtual ID created on the UIDAI website), (2) Full Name, (3) Date of Birth, (4) Gender, (5) Address, and (6) Your Photo. </p>
            <p class="text-grey">Digilocker is a part of the National eGovernance Division under the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India. The Digital Aadhaar issued within DigiLocker is the same as the eAadhaar issued by UIDAI (https://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in). DigiLocker has partnered with UIDAI to make it available automatically to its users when they link their DigiLocker account with Aadhaar. This act of issuing an eAadhaar within Digilocker and subsequently Digilocker sharing the information limited to the above points, leads to behaving as a physical KYC. Zerodha only receives information limited to the above points for the purposes of completing KYC of clients online. </p>
            <p class="text-grey">All clients may alternatively follow the offline route of account opening, which does not require sharing any Aadhaar related information.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">During your online account opening process, you would also be sharing your Aadhaar with Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. for the purpose of digitally signing the Zerodha account opening form. Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. does not share your Aadhaar with Zerodha. After the account opening form has been digitally signed by you, a copy of the digitally signed form would be emailed to you and to Zerodha for reference/audit purposes. Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is a licensed e-Sign ASP (Application Services Provider) with CDAC, compliant with the guidelines laid down by the Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), India and UIDAI, to enable you to eSign the account opening forms online.</p>
